# California Housing Data Analysis

## Overview
This project involves the analysis of California housing data to uncover insights and trends in the housing market. The analysis was conducted using a Jupyter Notebook and leverages various Python libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis.

## Project Objectives
- Load and clean the California housing dataset.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key trends and patterns.
- Visualize the data using different types of plots and graphs.
- Utilize statistical methods to interpret the data.

## Features
- Data Loading: Importing the dataset using pandas.
- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, and ensuring data consistency.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Generating summary statistics and visualizing data distributions.
- Data Visualization: Creating various plots using matplotlib and seaborn to illustrate findings.
- Statistical Analysis: Applying statistical methods to draw conclusions from the data.

## Skills Utilized
- **Python Programming**: Writing efficient and clean code to manipulate and analyze data.
- **Data Manipulation**: Using pandas for data loading, cleaning, and manipulation.
- **Data Visualization**: Leveraging matplotlib and seaborn for creating insightful visualizations.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Applying statistical techniques to interpret data trends and patterns.
- **Problem-Solving**: Tackling data-related challenges and deriving meaningful insights from the data.

## Libraries Used
